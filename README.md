# sean-cn

You can use the `shadcn` CLI to install my component registry.
That allows you to use my custom components, hooks, pages, and
other files in any React project.

## Getting Started

- The `registry.json` file defines components and their files.
- The `shadcn build` command is used to build the registry.
- The registry items are served as static files under `public/r/[name].json`.
- Includes a route handler for serving registry items.
- Every registry item are compatible with the `shadcn` CLI.
